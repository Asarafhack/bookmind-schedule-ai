# Welcome to your Lovable project

# üß† SmartPredict ‚Äì AI-Powered Desk & Shift Booking System

SmartPredict is a full-stack scheduling platform for hybrid workplaces. Built using **React**, **Flask**, and **Firebase**, it enables employees to book desks or shift slots, view real-time seat availability, and receive AI-based recommendations on optimal booking times.

Admins can view live booking dashboards, analyze utilization trends, and forecast future traffic using an ML model trained on historical data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### üîß Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables (for Firebase)
export FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID="..."
export FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="..."
export FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="..."
export FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID="..."

# Start Flask API
python app.py
```

### üíª Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## üß† AI Model

The ML model predicts hourly seat demand based on:

* Day of week
* Hour of day
* Department/team
* Historical data

Model is trained in `ml/train.py` and served via `/predict` API.

---

## üåê Deployment

* **Frontend:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
* **Backend API:** [Render](https://render.com)
* **Database & Auth:** Firebase (Free Tier)

---

## üìå Challenges Overcome

* Cross-Origin issues between React and Flask
* Firebase private key parsing in environment variables
* ML model integration in REST API
* Real-time sync between Firestore and seat UI

---

## üìé Future Improvements

* Google Calendar sync for shifts
* No-show prediction model
* Admin alerts for 90%+ occupancy
* Floor-plan based heatmap (SVG/Canvas)
